module Camping
  # == The Camping Reloader
  #
  # Camping apps are generally small and predictable.  Many Camping apps are
  # contained within a single file.  Larger apps are split into a handful of
  # other Ruby libraries within the same directory.
  #
  # Since Camping apps (and their dependencies) are loaded with Ruby's require
  # method, there is a record of them in $LOADED_FEATURES.  Which leaves a
  # perfect space for this class to manage auto-reloading an app if any of its
  # immediate dependencies changes.
  #
  # == Wrapping Your Apps
  #
  # Since bin/camping and the Camping::Server class already use the Reloader,
  # you probably don't need to hack it on your own.  But, if you're rolling your
  # own situation, here's how.
  #
  # Rather than this:
  #
  #   require 'yourapp'
  #
  # Use this:
  #
  #   require 'camping/reloader'
  #   reloader = Camping::Reloader.new('/path/to/yourapp.rb')
  #   blog = reloader.apps[:Blog]
  #   wiki = reloader.apps[:Wiki]
  #
  # The <tt>blog</tt> and <tt>wiki</tt> objects will behave exactly like your
  # Blog and Wiki, but they will update themselves if yourapp.rb changes.
  #
  # You can also give Reloader more than one script.
  class Reloader
    attr_reader :scripts, :apps

    # This class is doing all the hard work; however, it only works on
    # single files.  Reloader just wraps up support for multiple scripts
    # and hides away some methods you normally won't need.
